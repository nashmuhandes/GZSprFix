GZSprFix
--------

Compiled by Nash Muhandes

A conversion of Revenant100's Doom Minor Sprite Fixing Project and Heretic
Minor Sprite Fixing into a single, GZDoom-compatible mod.

First of all, this mod repacks the 2 mods mentioned above into one file,
utilizing GZDoom's filter folder feature so that only the relevant files will
get applied depending on the IWAD game you are running. For example: the
Heretic fixes won't be applied if you're playing the Doom games; or the Doom 2
fixes won't be applied if you're playing Doom 1, etc. What this means for the
user is that they can just have this single mod loaded globally for all games
without any potential issues arising from wrongly-loaded lumps.

Secondly, I have converted the Dehacked patches from Doom Sprite Fix into
ZScript.

Lastly, since this mod is meant for GZDoom, I've merged in my widescreen
versions of Doom's HELP* graphics, but only attaching the side extensions to
the Sprite Fix versions of the graphics. In other words, the center of the
HELP* graphics are from Sprite Fix (so they include the cleaned-up pixels),
but the sides are from WidePix (my widescreen graphics project that ships
with GZDoom starting from v4.5.0 onwards).

Note: The widescreen fixes from Heretic Minor Sprite Fixing have been
ommitted, in favor of GZDoom's own widescreen fixes for Heretic.
